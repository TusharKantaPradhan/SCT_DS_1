Global Population Analysis (1960-2024)
Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of historical and recent world population data sourced from the World Bank. The primary objective is to explore key demographic trends, identify significant patterns in population growth at global, regional, and national levels, and present these findings in a clear and interactive web-based dashboard. This project serves as a demonstration of a complete data analysis workflow, from data cleaning and preparation to insightful visualization and presentation.

Dataset
The analysis is based on three datasets provided by the World Bank, which contain comprehensive information about country populations over more than six decades.

API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_1182813.csv: The primary dataset containing the total population for every country and region from 1960 to 2024.

Metadata_Country_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_1182813.csv: A supplementary file providing metadata for each country, including its geographical region (e.g., "South Asia") and income group classification.

Metadata_Indicator_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_1182813.csv: A file describing the "Total Population" indicator and its data sources.
